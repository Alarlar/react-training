React Todo App

This project is a Todo application built with React as part of my learning journey through the React Fundamentals curriculum. It demonstrates key concepts such as state management, hooks, and asynchronous data handling.

I developed this Todo app to practice asynchronous data fetching, loading states, and conditional rendering. Initially, the app retrieved todo items synchronously from localStorage, but I updated it to simulate an asynchronous API call with a 2-second delay. I added a loading state to manage the data retrieval process and implemented a conditional loading indicator to improve user experience during the delay.

Technologies Used
React: For building the component-based UI.
JavaScript: For logic and state management.
Tailwind CSS: For styling the application.

localStorage: For persisting todo data in the browser.
Learning Objectives
This project aligns with the "Asynchronous Data Conditional Rendering Advanced and Impossible States" section of the React Fundamentals course. I focused on:

Simulating asynchronous behavior to prepare for real API integration.
Using the useState and useEffect hooks to manage loading states and side effects.
Applying conditional rendering to handle loading and content display.
Future Improvements

Integrate a real API for dynamic data fetching.
Add error handling for failed data retrieval.
Enhance the UI with more interactive features like todo editing and deletion.

Getting Started
Clone the repository: git clone <repository-url>
Open index.html in a web browser to run the app locally.
