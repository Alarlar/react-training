React Todo App

This project is a Todo application built with React as part of my learning journey through the React Fundamentals curriculum. It demonstrates key concepts such as state management, hooks, and asynchronous data handling.

I developed this Todo app to practice asynchronous data fetching, loading states, and conditional rendering. Initially, the app retrieved todo items synchronously from localStorage, but I updated it to simulate an asynchronous API call with a 2-second delay. I added a loading state to manage the data retrieval process and implemented a conditional loading indicator to improve user experience during the delay.
